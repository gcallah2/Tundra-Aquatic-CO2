    Multiple aquatic ecosystems (pond, lake, river, lagoon, ocean) on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) near Utqiaġvik, AK were visited to determine their relative contribution to landscape-level atmospheric CO2 flux and how this may have changed over time. pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) was monitored in late summer (late July to mid-August) over a period of four years (2013, 2015, 2017, 2018) from open water areas and is related to habitat type, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and environmental factors (temperature, radiation, rainfall). Data include both daily averages from most sites, as well as spatial representation of pCO2 in Elson Lagoon and diel cycles of pCO2 from a tundra pond. Pond NEP (net ecosystem production) is estimated by free water metabolism and presented as daily estimates over a four summer period.

  pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) was monitored in late summer
  (late July to mid-August) over a period of 4 years (2013, 2015, 2017,
  2018) from open water areas of a variety of aquatic habitats. pCO2 was
  monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes, to allow measurements to
  stabilize, up to a maximum of nearly 3 weeks of diel monitoring,
  depending on the site. At sites monitored on a diel basis, aquatic CO2
  was logged every minute using an NDIR CO2 sensor (Vaisala GMM 222)
  enclosed in a PFTE membrane (sensu (Hari et al. 2008, Johnson et al.
  2010, Bass et al. 2012) linked to a Campbell Scientific CR1000
  datalogger. At sites where continuous stations were not installed, a
  portable NDIR CO2 sensor (Vaisala GMT220) was allowed to stabilize for
  at least 30 minutes before a value was recorded. Data were converted
  to pCO2 using water temperature and pressure logged with a HOBO U20
  logger. CO2 flux (g C/m2/day) was calculated following corrections for
  diffusive exchange with the atmosphere estimated using wind-derived
  gas transfer co-efficients (k) (Wanninkhof 2014).

          
  DOC was measured on either a Lachat IL-550 or a Shimadzu TOC-V
  analyzer. DOC was measured as non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) on
  the Shimadzu instrument; data from the Lachat were converted to NPOC
  based on samples run on both machines (n=86; range 1.9 to 68 mg/L
  NPOC; r2=0.98).

          
  Downward total solar irradiance data were retrieved from Barrow
  Atmospheric Baseline Observatory (NOAA ESRL) prior to 2017. Post-2017,
  these data were acquired from NEON's Barrow Environmental Observatory
  Site (National Ecological Observatory Network 2018). A comparison
  between the 2 sites in 2017 was used to standardize the data among
  years (r2=0.97). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air
  temperature and rain data were collected from a HOBO weather station
  installed near IBP Pond C until 2013. Starting in 2015, rain data were
  retrieved from the National Weather Service, Barrow Airport; air
  temperatures and atmospheric CO2 were from NOAA ESRL. For
  identification of unusual temperature and radiation conditions, we
  calculated the 95th percentile of each of these based on all data from
  July and August in the 4 study years (2013, 2015, 2017, 2018); as
  such, this is not meant to be representative of a long-term analysis,
  but rather represents the study period in general.

          
  A YSI 6920 V2 multiparameter water quality sonde was deployed into
  IBP-C throughout the summers (early June- late August) of 2010-2013,
  and also for 3 weeks in late summer 2015, to record temperature and
  dissolved oxygen (DO) every 15 minutes. Data from the optical DO
  sensor was used to continually estimate NEP at IBP-C using a
  free-water metabolism (FWM) technique (Cole et al. 2000, Pace and
  Prairie 2004, Staehr et al. 2010), where hourly NEP is expressed as a
  function of the change in O2 minus diffusion. Diffusion and other
  parameters were calculated using formulae and steps described in
  detail elsewhere (Staehr et al. 2010). Even though there is no period
  of darkness in June-July in Utqiaġvik, we assumed that PAR at 2am was
  sufficiently low (Median = 35) to allow for estimation of respiration
  (R), prior to the sun setting in early August; however, it is worth
  noting that this assumption may be less robust at the beginning of the
  summer when the sun does not set. Sensor-based DO was validated
  against lab analyses using the Winkler method (Wetzel and Likens
  2000).

This project established a new Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site along the Alaskan Arctic coastline. Research based out of Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Deadhorse, and Kaktovik will address how changes in shoreline erosion and freshwater inflows to the coastal ocean over seasonal, annual, and longer timeframes influence near-shore food webs. Research will be conducted in collaboration with local stakeholder groups and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This research will advance our fundamental understanding of how input of materials from land and oceanographic conditions interact to influence coastal food webs. It will also allow us to track and understand: 1) how natural climate cycles influence coastal ecosystems in the Arctic, and 2) how climate change effects such as permafrost thaw, shifting precipitation regimes, and losses of sea ice alter coastal ecosystems. Near-shore food webs along the Alaskan Arctic coastline support large populations of migratory fish and waterfowl that are essential to the culture of Iñupiat communities of northern Alaska. The research at this LTER site will create a framework for anticipating the impacts of future changes on the coastal ecosystem that are of great concern to these communities. Results from this LTER program will also be of interest to a broader science community that is working to understand potential connections between Arctic change and global carbon cycling. Finally, this LTER project includes a strong commitment to education through graduate and undergraduate student involvement, post-doctoral mentoring, continuation of a very successful Summer Science K-12 Program in Kaktovik, and establishment of a parallel K-12 program in Utqiagvik. In addition, this project will employ native high school seniors or recently graduated students living in Utqiagvik and Kaktovik as field research assistants. 
 
          Recent studies suggest that the ecological framework for understanding what controls food web structure needs to be expanded to include temporal forcing. More specifically, there is mounting evidence that differential availability of seasonally-distinct resources is critical for defining trophic linkages and maintaining stability and resilience of food webs. This new LTER program will use lagoons along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast as experimental units to test this concept, and broaden it to include temporal variations over longer timeframes. The Beaufort lagoons are ideal for testing this concept because they experience extreme variability in seasonal cycles, which are now subject to rapid directional shifts driven by climate change. Our overarching question is: How do variations in terrestrial inputs, local production, and exchange between lagoon and ocean waters over seasonal, inter-annual, inter-decadal, and longer timeframes interact to control food web structure through effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling, microbial and metazoan community composition, and trophic linkages? Arctic lagoons provide a unique opportunity to study these interactions in the absence of fringing wetlands that often modulate land-ocean interactions in other lagoon systems. In addition, barrier island geomorphology, which exerts a strong control on water exchange between lagoons and the open ocean, is highly dynamic in the Arctic because sea-ice effects on coastal geomorphology are superimposed on the effects of currents, sea level, and waves. Thus, connections between inputs from land and lagoon ecosystems are more direct, and water exchanges between lagoons and the open ocean are more variable than is typical of lower latitude systems. Specific study sites will be located in Elson Lagoon (western Beaufort), Simpson Lagoon and Stefansson Sound (central Beaufort), and Kaktovik and Jago lagoons (eastern Beaufort). The LTER will include seasonal field work during ice covered, ice break-up, and open water periods and also include sensor deployments for continuous measurements of key biogeochemical and hydrographic parameters.
